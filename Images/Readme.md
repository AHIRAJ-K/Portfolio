# Logos and Images

This folder contains logo assets and images used in the portfolio website.

File updates here will reflect on the live site after deployment.  
Ensure logos and images are optimized for the web (e.g., SVG or compressed PNG formats).

## Image Guidelines:
- **Logos**: Include logos of software, tools, and educational institutions.
- **Project Images**: Use images that showcase your projects or achievements.
- **Optimization**: Use SVGs for logos when possible for scalability, and PNG/JPG for other images with appropriate compression to keep the website fast.
